Creating a console converter

Currency converter => Currency conversion is of practical use to tourists who travel abroad, businesses who do business overseas or are involved in imports and exports, and FX traders. A universal currency converter is an app or web tool that allows for the quick conversion of any currency into any other currency.

Note: different countries have their own currency conversion rate, so we will be implementing so many countries like naira to the dollar.
